## Breakdown of the game and how it works

Lidell is a guessing game for UFC fighters where users gain hints based on the attributes of the fighters that they guess in comparison to the mystery fighter (The fighter they are trying to guess). Attributes include HomeTown, Age, Reach, Division, Name, Record, and Ranking. If the user guesses a fighter and their attribute is close to the same as the mystery fighter, that attribute will show up yellow to indicate a near match. If the attributes are the same they will change to green and if they are neither similar nor the same they will not change colour. We also implemented a leaderboard for players to compare their scores to other players. 

You can find a breakdown of the game in our Technical Guide document which can be found in the documents folder and there is also a User Manual in here to show you how to set up the app and play the game.
